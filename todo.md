- [ ] have somewhere to enter how long the meetings are, and show that in a graph (TOP PRIORITY)
- [ ] show the person's GH avatar beside an issue if they're assigned to it
- [x] add a readme
- [x] show tags beside issue titles
- [ ] have a button to commit all of the current issues in the list for a sprint ("check all" button?)
- [x] authentication support
- [x] ability to view a consolidation of sprints (i.e. just take all the data for two or more sprints, and present it as if it were one)
  - [ ] Should also be able to view the velocity calculated over the selected sprints
- [ ] Generate probability of completion time stats for different issues sizes
  - Take all the issues of a certain size, look at how much absolute time they took to move from building to ready for deploy, and create a probability distribution
- [ ] a project view. Allow selection of a label, and display all of the issues associated with that label, with stats
 - user has to choose the labels they want to monitor. issues don't get included in the snapshot until they're monitored
 - separate snapshots are created for these projects (but the snapshot can (potentially) reference the same issue snapshots (??))
 - page displays:
   - completion percentage (progress) over time (same as for sprint)
     - On same graph, display total points
   - The current counts of completed points, remaining points and total points
- [ ] auto-move issues into the next sprint on Friday afternoons
- [ ] try to figure out who worked on issues and provide counts
 - could look at comments to figure out who gave +1, and at commit history to just include anyone who committed
- [ ] Have a cooler visualization on the issue page - something like a horizontal bar for each sprint, with the bar broken up into coloured chunks for each state the issue was in (so you can see how long it was in each state, and how those periods spanned sprints)

- [ ] on homepage, display both committed completion and total completion
 - maybe with little bar graphs?
- [ ] start date for a sprint (maybe derive by default, but allow it to be editable)
- [ ] spark line in homepage list
- [ ] configurable granularity on sprint page (i.e. only one snapshot per day or per hour or whatever)
- [ ] make it look pretty
- [ ] consider turning the whole thing into the usual frontend app/backend api thing, with an actual frontend framework, blah blah blah
- [ ] Use LESS/Coffeescript/etc..
- [ ] once project stuff is implemented, have super awesome calendar view that just figures out when everything will be done based on velocity, position of issues in queue, etc..
